## Introduction to Operational Scheduling

Operational Schedule allows you to schedule when your TV powers on/off and to control the volume and brightness through the device level, HDMI-CEC, or RS-232 connections. HDMI-CEC is a popular feature available on most consumer TVs right now, while RS-232 is useful for commercial-grade displays.

|  |
| --- |
| Limitations |
| - You will need the **Pro+ Plan** or above to have access to this HDMI-CEC and RS-232 feature. The HDMI-CEC or RS-232 capabilities allow you to Power On/Off your TV using the Operational Schedule, and change the volume or mute the screen. |
| - If you have the **Free** or **Standard** plan and create an Operational Schedule, the player will display black to save power and device life. Free and Standard plan users will not have access to the "Advanced Scheduling" option: Advanced Scheduling toggle in the Operational Schedule dialog header, switched off |
| - To access Operational Schedule with an HDMI-CEC port, you will need our [**OptiStick**](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-android-stick-player-2), [**Pro Signage Player**](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-digital-signage-player), [**ProMax Player**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/38680194603155-OptiSigns-ProMax-Player). The player will need to be plugged in to an HDMI-CEC port to function. RS-232 functionality can be used with any device which supports it.   - Please ensure your Android Player device is ***powered from an outlet, not the screen's USB port.***If plugged into the USB port, the act of turning off the screen will also power off the device - meaning, it will not be able to turn the screen back on.   - Operational Scheduling is not supported on Roku nor Samsung Tizen devices. The option will not be visible. |

**One last important note:**

HDMI-CEC is referred to by numerous names. Depending on the brand of your TV or device, it might be called something else, and may need to be enabled in the device software.

Here is a complete list of [**TV Manufacturer CEC Names**](https://support.klipsch.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045728971-TV-Manufacturer-CEC-Names). Simply find your device on the list and enable HDMI-CEC, if necessary.

### Schedules vs. Operational Schedules

**Operational Schedules** are distinct from **Schedules**, which allow you to schedule the actual content which appears on a digital sign.

- **Operational Schedules** are for turning *on and off the actual display*.
- **Schedules** are for displaying *what content or playlists will display on the display*.

For more on Schedules, see our article on [**Creating and Using Schedules**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016981853-Creating-and-Using-Schedules-with-OptiSigns).

    ![Power State dropdown open, showing On, Off and None](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55337722717203)

  - **HDMI-CEC:** Will exclusively attempt to power on/off your device via HDMI-CEC connection.

|  |
| --- |
| **Note:** On Auto, y*our device will try RS-232 first if available, then HDMI-CEC command to turn off TV/Monitor. Your TV/Monitor model and player needs to support this feature for it to work. Players sold by OptiSigns support HDMI-CEC and RS-232.* |

- **Mute:**Choose if you'd like your screen to be mute or not if sound is available.
- **Volume:**Adjust the volume of the screen.
- **Brightness:** Adjust the brightness of the screen, with 100% being your screen's current brightness.

- **HDMI Lock:**If checked, the system will periodically check which HDMI input the TV is using. If it detects that the TV has been switched away from the OptiSigns HDMI-CEC input, it will automatically switch back. This check runs approximately once every hour.

**3.**Make sure to **Save** your event at the bottom so that it will assign the event to the schedule. Then, click "**Apply**" to assign it to your screen.

![Week calendar showing the saved event, with Apply at the bottom right](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55337755018259)
